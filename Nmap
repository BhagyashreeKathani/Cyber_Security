Vulnerability Scanning Report : 
Vulnerability scanning identify slowloris DoS attack, weak in the SSL/TLS configuration and website having CSRF vulnerabilities in several forms.

•	Slowloris DoS Attack (CVE-2007-6750) : 
State : LIKELY VULNERABILITY
  Port Affected: 80 (HTTP)
        Severity: Critical
      
  The target is susceptible to the Slowloris Denial of Service (DoS) attack, where the attacker keeps many connections open and sends partial requests, exhausting server resources.


•	Weak Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange
                  Port Affected: 443 (HTTPS)
                  Severity: High
                 The SSL/TLS configuration uses a weak 1024-bit Diffie-Hellman key exchange. This is vulnerable to passive eavesdropping attacks, especially when using weakly generated groups.

 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Vulnerabilities
•	Severity: Medium
            The scan identified several forms across the site (e.g., frmsearch, search.jsp) that are susceptible to CSRF attacks. These forms can be abused by attackers to submit unauthorized requests on behalf of a logged-in user.
